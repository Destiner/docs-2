## Partner Rewards

Partner rewards share a percentage of protocol fees with partners. Partners earn rewards by integrating STP into their applications or onboarding new users to the protocol.
Any fees generated by these users will be split with the partner in perpetuity.

### How does it work?

Once a partner is onboarded, they receive a unique partner ID. This ID is used to track the partner's rewards and is passed to the protocol when a user is onboarded.
Deploying a new STP contract with the partner ID will configure the deployment so all fees are sent to a [0xSplits](https://docs.splits.org/) contract.
The splits contract maintains the the split ratio between the partner(s) and the protocol. Funds in the splits contract are distributed and claimed pro-rata by each member.

### How do I become a partner?

A Fabric multisig is responsible for adding new fee splits to the protocol and requires manual work. If you are interested in becoming a partner, please reach out on [Telegram](https://t.me/withfabric).
