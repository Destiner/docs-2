# STP SDK

Fabric currently provides a typescipt SDK targetting wagmi/wagmi-core. The source is avilable on [GitHub](https://github.com/withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/tree/main)

### Installation

```
npm i @withfabric/protocol-sdks
```

### Usage

Since the SDK depends on wagmi, all functions will leverage the wagmi config. By default, actions target the connected chain, but chainId can be overriden on any call.

Simple example for a mint transaction:

```typescript
import {
  prepareMint,
} from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

const mint = await prepareMint({
  contractAddress: '0x...',
  amount: 100_000n,
})

const receipt = await mint();
```

Examples for other actions can be found throughout the documentation.
