# Advanced Usage

Advanced functions are available for managing the contract. These functions are not required for normal operation.

## Adjusting Global Supply Cap

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can adjust the supply cap.
</Callout>

The maxmimum number of subscribers can be adjusted using the `setGlobalSupplyCap` function. The supply cap can be set to any value greater or equal to the current supply. Additionally, the
supply cap can be set to 0 to allow unlimited subscribers (default). This is in addition to tier specific supply caps.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareSetSupplyCap } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  const setCap = await prepareSetSupplyCap({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    supplyCap: 1000n,
  });

  const receipt = await setCap();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Transfering Ownership

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can transfer ownership.
</Callout>

Transfers are two step, using transfer + accept. Transfers are started via the `setPendingOwner` function.
**This can be used to stage a backup owner**, or to transfer ownership to a new owner.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareTransferOwnership } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  const transfer = await prepareTransferOwnership({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    newOwner: '0x...',
  });

  const receipt = await transfer();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Accepting Ownership

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the PENDING contract owner can accept ownership
</Callout>

Once a transfer is started, the pending owner must call `acceptOwnership` to complete the transfer.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareAcceptOwnership } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  const accept = await prepareAcceptOwnership({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
  });

  const receipt = await accept();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Recovering Misplaced Tokens

In the event that tokens are accidentally sent to the contract, they can be recovered using the `recoverCurrency(address tokenAddress, address recipientAddress, uint256 tokenAmount)` function. This will also work for native tokens if `tokenAddress` is set to 0x0.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can reconcile the ERC20 balance.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">
  This function will revert if `tokenAddress` matches the contract's denominated currency token.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareRecoverCurrency } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  const recover = await prepareRecoverCurrency({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    tokenAddress: '0x...',
    recipientAddress: '0x...',
    tokenAmount: 1000n,
  });

  const receipt = await recover();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
