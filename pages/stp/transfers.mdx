# Transfers

The owners's cut of funds are held in the contract. The owner of the contract can withdraw these funds at any time. The `contractDetail()` function includes `creatorBalance` indicating the balance available to transfer.

Upon calling `transferFunds`, the creator's balance is adjusted and the funds are transferred to a destination address.

## Perform a Transfer

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can transfer funds to arbitrary accounts.
</Callout>

The `transferFunds` function transfers some or all of the balance to a destination account.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import {
    prepareTransferFunds,
  } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  const transfer = await prepareTransferFunds({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    to: '0x...',
    amount: 1000n,
  });

  const receipt = await transfer();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Alternative Transfer Recipient

It's also possible to transfer the balance to a configured recipient via `transferFunds()`. In order for this functionality to work, the creator must
call the `setTransferRecipient(address recipient)` function. This functionality can later be disabled by setting the address to 0x0 (default).

If the transfer recipient is set, the `transferFunds()` function can be called permissionlessly, as long as the `recipient` address matches the configured recipient. This functionality is useful for creators who want to automate the transfers or stream funds via external agent. For example, a creator may want to automatically transfer funds to a cold wallet, a multisig wallet, an exchange, or a sweep contract.

Setting the transfer recipient:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can set the transfer recipient
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import {
    prepareSetTransferRecipient,
  } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  const setRecipient = await prepareSetTransferRecipient({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    recipient: '0x...',
  });

  const receipt = await setRecipient();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Once the transfer recipient is set, any account can call transfer as long as the passed to address equals the configured transfer recipient address.
