# Refunds

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can issue refunds
</Callout>

Creators can issue refunds to subscribers as needed. Upon refunding a subscriber, the remaining purchased time is revoked, and a specified amount of tokens are transferred to the account. The token itself it not burned or deactivated and can be used to purchase a subscription again.

The source of funds for the refund is the contract's balance. If the contract balance is insufficient, the `topUp` function can be called to add more funds to creators balance.

  ```ts
  import {
    prepareRefund,
  } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  const refund = await prepareRefund({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    account: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92264',
    amount: 50_000n, // Number of tokens to refund
  });

  const receipt = await refund();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Eviction

The `refund`, `revokeTime`, and `deactivateSubscription` functions can be called in sequence to refund a subscriber, revoke their granted time, and deactivate their subscription. This can be done with a single transaction to ensure the subscriber is refunded and removed from the contract.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import {
    prepareTopUp,
  } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  const account = '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92264';
  const evict = await prepareMulticall({
    contractAddress: collection.contract.contract_address! as `0x${string}`,
    calls: [{
      functionName: 'refund',
      args: [account, 0n],
    },{
      functionName: 'revokeTime',
      args: [account],
    },{
      functionName: 'deactivateSubscription',
      args: [account],
    }]
  });

  const receipt = await evict();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Note: Evicting a user assumes there are constraints on the tiers that would prevent them from re-joining.


## Top Up Creator Balance

Note: If ERC20, an approval will need to be issued before calling `topUp`.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import {
    prepareTopUp,
  } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  const topup = await prepareTopUp({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    amount: 50_000n, // Number of tokens to add to the creators balance
  });

  const receipt = await refund();
  ```
