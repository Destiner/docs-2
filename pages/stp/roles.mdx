# Privileged Roles

There are several roles in the STP contract. Each role has different permissions. Owners can grant specific roles to other accounts to delegate responsibilities. This is helpful when the owner is a DAO or multisig.

* Owner
* Manager
* Agent
* Issuer
* Protocol Fee Recipient
* Client Fee Recipient

#### Owner Role

The owner is set to the creator (msg.sender) address upon deployment, unless otherwise specified. The owner has complete control over the contract. The exclusive controls of the owner are as follows:

* Creating or revoking Managers and Agents `setRoles`
* Transferring ownership `setPendingOwner`
* Updating the Transfer Recipient `setTransferRecipient`
* Withdrawing funds to any address other than the transfer recipient `tranferFunds`
* Refunding subscribers with contract funds `refund`
* Token recovery `recoverCurrency`

#### Manager Role

Managers can control nearly all metadata in the contract. Managers can do the following:

* Grant Time `grantTime`
* Revoke Time `revokeTime`
* Update Metadata URL `setMetadataURL`
* Set Global Supply Cap `setGlobalSupplyCap`
* Create Tiers `createTier`
* Update Tiers `updateTier`
* Manage Referral Codes `setReferralCode`
* Create Reward Curves `createRewardCurve`

#### Agent Role

Agents are designed to grant and revoke time to subscribers. Agents can do the following:

* Grant Time `grantTime`
* Revoke Time `revokeTime`

#### Issuer Role

Issuers are intended to allow reward pool share issuance for off-chain or on-chain activities beyond minting subscriptions. Privileges:

* Issue Reward Shares `issueRewardShares`

#### Protocol Fee Recipient

The protocol fee recipient is the address that receives the protocol fee. The protocol fee is a percentage of the subscription price. The protocol fee recipient can do the following:

* Update the protocol fee recipient `updateProtocolFeeRecipient`
* Remove protocol fees `updateProtocolFeeRecipient(0x0)`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  `updateProtocolFeeRecipient` must be invoked via the factory contract `updateProtocolFeeRecipient`, which supports multicall
</Callout>

#### Client Fee Recipient

The client fee recipient is the address that receives the client fee. The client fee is a percentage of the subscription price. The client fee recipient can do the following:

* Update the client fee recipient `updateClientFeeRecipient`
* Remove client fees `updateClientFeeRecipient(0x0)`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  `updateClientFeeRecipient` must be invoked via the factory contract `updateClientFeeRecipient`, which supports multicall
</Callout>

## Setting Roles

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can grant and revoke roles
</Callout>

Roles can be set using the `setRoles` function. The roles are represented as a bitmask. The following roles are available:

* ROLE_MANAGER = 1
* ROLE_AGENT = 2
* ROLE_ISSUER = 4

  ```ts
  import {
    prepareSetRoles,
    Role,
  } from '@withfabric/protocol-sdks/stpv2';

  // Add MANAGER and ISSUER roles to the account
  const grant = await prepareSetRoles({
    contractAddress: `0x...`,
    account: `0x...`,
    roles: [Role.MANAGER, Role.ISSUER],
  });

  const receipt = await grant();

  // Revoke
  const revoke = await prepareSetRoles({
    contractAddress: `0x...`,
    account: `0x...`,
    roles: [],
  });

  const receipt2 = await revoke();
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```solidity
  // Add MANAGER role to the account
  contract.setRoles(alice, 0x2);

  // Revoke
  contract.setRoles(alice, 0x0);
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Factory Owner

The factory owner is the owner of the factory contract. The factory owner can do the following:

* Initiate ownership transfer `setPendingOwner`
* Set the protocol fee recipient `setProtocolFeeRecipient`
* Set a deploy fee `setDeployFee`
