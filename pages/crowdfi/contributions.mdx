# Contributing Funds

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

Contributions are allowed as long as the following conditions are met:

1. The campaign has started
2. The campaign has not ended
3. The campaign max goal is not met
4. The contribution amount doesn't violate the min and max contribution amounts for the contributing account

#### Contributing ETH

Contributions are made to ETH denominated contracts by invoking the `contributeEth()` function with msg.value set to the amount of wei.

<Tabs items={['ethers', 'foundry']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { Contract, Signer } from 'ethers';

  const abi = require('path/to/CrowdFinancingV1.abi.json');
  const contribute = async (campaignAddress: string, signer: Signer, amount: bigint) : Promise<any> => {
    const contract = new Contract(campaignAddress, abi, signer);
    return contract.contributeEth({
      gasLimit: 200_000,
      value: amount,
    });
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  cast send ${CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS} "contributeEth()" --value ${AMOUNT} --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --ledger
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Contributing ERC-20 Tokens

Contributions are made to ERC-20 denominated contracts by invoking the `contributeERC20(amount)` function. This first requires
that the campaign contract has an allowance greater than or equal to the amount specified in the call.

If the contracts allowance for the ERC-20 token is less than the amount specified, then the transaction will revert.

  ```ts
  import { Contract, Signer } from 'ethers';

  const abi = require('path/to/CrowdFinancingV1.abi.json');
  const contribute = async (campaignAddress: string, signer: Signer, amount: bigint) : Promise<any> => {
    const erc20 = new Contract(erc20ContractAddress, erc20Abi, signer);
    const txn = await erc20.approve(campaignAddress, amount);

    await pollForReceipt(txn.hash);

    const contract = new Contract(campaignAddress, abi, signer);
    return contract.contributeERC20(amount, {
      gasLimit: 200_000,
    });
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  cast send ${TOKEN_ADDRESS} "approve(address,uint256)" ${CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS} ${AMOUNT} --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --ledger
  # await for transaction to be mined
  cast send ${CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS} "contributeERC20(uint256)" ${AMOUNT} --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --ledger
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Preflight Checks

Before contributing funds to the contract, it's best to check if contributions are allowed and to check the min and max contribution amounts
for a given account.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If an account attempts to contribute a value outside the range, the transaction will revert
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['ethers']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  async function isContributionValid(contract: Contract, account: string, amount: bigint) : Promise<boolean> {
    const allowed = await contract.isContributionAllowed();
    const { 0: low, 1: high } = await contract.contributionRangeFor(account);
    return allowed && amount >= low && amount <= high;
  }
  ```
