# Transferring Funds

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

Transfers can occur if the following conditions are met:

1. The min goal is met AND the campaign has ended
2. The max goal is met

Any account can initiate the transfer, but all funds will be transferred to the recipient address.

#### Invoking Transfer

<Tabs items={['ethers', 'foundry']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  const txn = await campaignContract.transferBalanceToRecipient();
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  cast send ${CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS} "transferBalanceToRecipient()" --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --ledger
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


#### Preflight Checks

Before invoking transfer, it's best to check that transfer is allowed

<Tabs items={['ethers', 'foundry']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  const txn = await campaignContract.isTransferAllowed();
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  cast call ${CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS} "isTransferAllowed()" --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --ledger
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Fees

  The protocol currently has all fees set to 0
</Callout>

There are two types of optional fees which are collected at time of transfer

1. Transfer fee - A percentage of tokens are taken before transfer and sent to the fee recipient
2. Yield fee - A percentage of tokens to mint for the fee recipient (effectively diluting the supply)

These fees are set at time of campaign deployment and will not change after deployment.
