# Transferring Funds

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

Transfers can occur if the following conditions are met:

1. The min goal is met AND the campaign has ended
2. OR the max goal is met

Any account can initiate the transfer, but all funds will be transferred to the recipient address.

#### Invoking Transfer

```ts
const txn = await contract.transferBalanceToRecipient();
```

#### Fees

  The protocol currently has all fees set to 0
</Callout>

There are two types of fees which are captured at time of transfer

1. Transfer fee - A percentage of tokens are taken before transfer and sent to the fee recipient
2. Yield fee - A percentage of tokens to mint for the fee recipient

These fees are set at time of campaign deployment and will not change after deployment.

#### Preflight Checks

Before invoking transfer, it's best to check that transfer is allowed

```ts
const allowed : boolean = await contract.isTransferAllowed();
```
