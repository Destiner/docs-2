# ERC-20 Compliance

All CrowdFi campaigns are ERC-20 compliant to facilitate transfers between accounts. Upon contributing tokens, an equal amount of crowdfi tokens are minted and allocated to the contributing account.

Every deployed campaign represents a unique ERC-20 token.

The contracts currently don't have configurable token names and symbols, but this could be added in a future version.
