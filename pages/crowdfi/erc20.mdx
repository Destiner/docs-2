# ERC-20 Compliance

All CrowdFi campaigns are ERC-20 compliant, to facilitate transfers of campaign tokens between accounts. Upon contributing funding tokens to a campaign, a corresponding amount of campaign tokens are minted and allocated to the contributing account.

Every deployed campaign represents a unique ERC-20 token.

The contracts currently don't have configurable token names and symbols, but this could be added in a future version.
