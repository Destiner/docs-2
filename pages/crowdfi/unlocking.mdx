# Unlocking Funds

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

If transfer does not occur within 90 days the campaign end date, the unlockFailedFunds function may be invoked,
which puts the campaign into a failed state and allows contributors to withdraw their funds.

This scenario is unlikely to occur, but is included as a failsafe in case the campaign recipient address is malicious or fails to receive native tokens for any reason.

Any account can unclock funds.

#### Invoking Transfer

<Tabs items={['ethers', 'foundry']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  const txn = await campaignContract.unlockFailedFunds();
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  cast send ${CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS} "unlockFailedFunds()" --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --ledger
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


#### Preflight Checks

Before invoking unlockFailedFunds, it's best to check that unlocking is allowed.

<Tabs items={['ethers', 'foundry']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  const txn = await campaignContract.isUnlockAllowed();
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  cast call ${CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS} "isUnlockAllowed()" --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --ledger
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
