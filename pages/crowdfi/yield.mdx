The CrowdFi protocol supports payment splitting between token holders. If the purpose
of the campaign was to finance a project which yields returns, those returns may be
transferred to the contract and all token holders can withdraw their portion at any time.

#### Yielding Native Tokens

Example yielding 1 Eth to the contract for the contributors to share

```ts
const txn = await contract.yieldEth({ value: BigInt(Math.pow(10, 18)) })
```

#### Yielding ERC20 Tokens

Like contributions, ERC20 yields require allowances.

```ts
const amount = BigInt((Math.pow(10, 6));
const txn = await tokenContract.approve(contract.address, amount);
const txn = await contract.yieldERC20(amount);
```
