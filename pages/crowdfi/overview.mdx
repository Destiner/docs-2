# CrowdFi Protocol Overview

![](/campaign_arch.png)


The Fabric crowdfinancing protocol moves capital between creators and communities.

Here’s how it works:

1. A creator deploys a crowdfinancing contract onchain,
2. Contributors deposit funds into the contract,
3. If the goal is met, then the recipient can withdraw the pooled funds from the contract, else contributors can withdraw their deposits.

Optionally:

4. Yield generated from deployed capital can be deposited back into the contract by the recipient,
5. Contributors can then withdraw a percentage of this yield in proportion to their initial contribution (pro rata).

The protocol is a non-upgradable, EVM-compatible smart contract that can be permissionlessly used to pool capital and verifiably share upside. It lives at the intersection of a crowdfunding project, escrow account, and cap table.

Such is the combinatorial power of crypto-economic software.


## Protocol

### Contract

Crowdfinancing contracts are the atomic unit of the protocol. They are what creators deploy onchain, contributors deposit funds into, and recipients withdraw from. They are also used to distribute yield.

They have the following parameters:


    **Goal**
    Goals are discreet min and max funding targets. Goals are *all or nothing*, meaning that recipients can only withdraw if the minimum funding target has been met.


    **Token**
    Goals are denominated in ETH or any valid ERC-20 token, such as USDC or DAI.

    **Duration**
    Discreet start and end times.

    **Recipient**
    Recipients are the benefactors of the funding goal. They can be any valid address, be it an individual wallet, multisig, or other smart contract such as a DAO or DeFi protocol.


### Creator

Anyone can deploy a crowdfinancing contract: founders, community builders, artists, DAOs, gaming guilds, freelance collectives, schools, co-ops, nonprofits, neighborhood and homeowners associations, for profit companies, etc.


### Contributor

Deposits can be made into the contract by any valid address, be it an individual wallet, multisig, or smart contract.


## Fees

The protocol can collect three types of fees:


1. Deployment

A flat fee in order to deploy a crowdfinancing contract onchain.


2. Capital

A percentage of the total funds raised.


3. Yield

A percentage of the returns generated from deployed capital.

All are currently set to zero. In the future, if we decide to enable fees, they will accrue to the Fabric protocol treasury, not Fabric Inc.

## Risks

Though the protocol has been audited by an independent third-party and thoroughly tested prior to deploying, it is not without risk.


### Creators

Fabric does not (and can not) control who uses the protocol. It is *non-upgradable*, *decentralized*, and *permissionless* which means that in addition to the types of creators mentioned above, scammers, spammers, fraudsters, charlatans, evildoers, and other economic agents of low moral character can also use it. Do your own research and verify the creator address prior to contributing.


### Recipients

Just like creators, recipients can also be any valid address. Do your own research and verify the recipient address prior to contributing.


### Yield

For yield generated offchain, there is currently no onchain mechanism by which to enforce deposits back into the contract. In this case, contributors are dependent on the recipient—and whatever out-of-band means may exist—to follow through on their promise of returns.


### Compliance

Know your rights. Seek counsel from a qualified attorney who can advise on relevant legal and regulatory restrictions in your area. Economic freedom is not yet evenly distributed.


### Clients

Anyone can launch a crowdfinancing client. Do your own research and verify that whatever interface you use to interact with the protocol has been developed by a reputable source.


## The World Is Yours

People have been pooling capital and sharing upside for centuries. The Fabric crowdfinancing protocol now codifies this basic human impulse into a permissionless, decentralized smart contract that anyone, anywhere in the world can use. No gatekeepers, no middle-men, no masters.

The world is yours.
