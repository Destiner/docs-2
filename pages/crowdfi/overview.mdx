# Fabric CrowdFi Protocol

Fabric is a decentralized protocol for moving capital between creators and contributors.

Here’s how it works:

1. A creator deploys a crowdfunding contract onchain,
2. Contributors deposit capital into the contract,
3. If the funding target is met then the creator can withdraw the pooled capital, else contributors can withdraw their deposits.

Optionally:

4. Yield generated from deployed capital can be deposited back into the contract by the creator,
5. Contributors can then withdraw a percentage of this yield in proportion to their initial contribution (pro rata).

The protocol is a non-upgradable smart contract on ethereum mainnet that can be permissionlessly used to pool capital and verifiably share upside. It lives at the intersection of a crowdfunding project, escrow account, and cap table.

Such is the combinatorial power of crypto-economic software.


## Creators

Anyone can deploy a crowdfunding contract with the Fabric protocol: founders, community builders, artists, DAOs, gaming guilds, freelance collectives, co-ops, nonprofits, neighborhood and home owner’s associations, for profit companies, etc.


## Contributors

Contributions can be made to the contract by any valid address, be it an individual wallet, multisig, or other smart contract such as a DAO or DeFi protocol.


## Crowdfunds

Crowdfunds are the atomic unit of the Fabric protocol. They are what creators deploy onchain, contributors deposit funds into, and yield distributions are withdrawn from. They have the following properties:

**Goal**
Discreet min and max funding targets.

**Contribution**
Discreet min and max contribution amounts.

**Duration**
Discreet start and end times.


## Fees

The protocol can collect three types of fees:

##### Deployment
A flat fee in order to deploy a crowdfunding contract onchain.

##### Capital

A percentage of the total amount of capital raised.

##### Yield

A percentage of the total returns generated from deployed capital.

All three are currently set to 0. In the future, if we decide to enable fees they will accrue to the Fabric protocol treasury, not Fabric Inc.


## Risks

**Creators**
Fabric does not (and can not) control who uses the protocol. It is non- upgradable, decentralized, and permissionless which means that in addition to the types of creators mentioned above, scammers, spammers, fraudsters, charlatans, evildoers, and other economic agents of low moral character can use it too.

We highly recommend vetting creators prior to contributing funds to their crowdfunding campaign.

**Compliance**
Prior to offering or participating in any return-producing crowdfund it is up to you to ensure legal and regulatory compliance within your jurisdiction. We recommend hiring a qualified attorney to advise on how best to make use of the Fabric protocol for your unique use case.

**Yield**
For yield generated offchain there is no onchain mechanism by which to enforce deposits back into the crowdfunding contract. In this case, contributors are entirely dependent on the creator and whatever out of band means might exist to compel them to comply with the claims they made regarding yield distributions.
