# Fabric Crowdfunding Protocol

Fabric is a decentralized protocol for transferring capital between creators and contributors.

Here’s how it works:

A creator deploys a crowdfunding contract onchain,
Contributors deposit capital into the contract,
If the funding target is met then the creator can withdraw the pooled capital, else contributors can withdraw their deposits.
Optionally:

Yield generated from deployed capital can be deposited back into the contract by the creator,
Contributors can then withdraw a percentage of this yield in proportion to their initial contribution (pro rata).
The protocol is a non-upgradable smart contract on ethereum mainnet that can be permissionlessly used to pool capital and share upside. It lives at the intersection of a crowdfunding project, escrow account, and cap table.

Such is the combinatorial power of crypto-economic software.

Creators
Anyone can deploy a crowdfunding contract with the Fabric protocol: founders, community builders, artists, DAOs, gaming guilds, freelancer collectives, co-ops, nonprofits, neighborhood associations, for profit companies, etc.

And because Fabric is decentralized and permissionless: scammers, spammers, fraudsters, charlatans, evildoers, and other economic agents of low moral character.

Contributors
Contributions can be made to the crowdfunding contract by any valid address, be it an individual wallet, multisig, or other smart contract such as a DAO or DeFi protocol.

Campaigns
The atomic unit of the Fabric protocol is a campaign. Put simply, campaigns are ideas with a willingness and ability to execute that are in search of capital. They have the following properties:

Goal
Discreet min and max funding targets.

Contribution
Discreet min and max contribution amounts.

Duration
Discreet start and end times.
